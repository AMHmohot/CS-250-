## 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Mastery of this, in my opinion, is a process that requires time. Small, straightforward releases can accommodate any kind of modification, provided that the channel of communication with the end-user remains open. User stories are useful for simplifying customer requirements since they inquire, "Who?," "What?," and "Why?." 
1. To whom is this change being made? 
2. What is the user's desired outcome? 
3. What makes this change necessary? 

## 2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Agile has given me the framework I need to continue expanding my knowledge of project management in various contexts. When it comes to development, I believe organization is key, and agile allows for that along with flexibility and adaptability. With less pressure to meet deadlines, development teams are free to concentrate on creating value for users, which improves their ability to meet their expectations time and time again. Ideally, my future endeavors will make use of digital applications such as Azure, Jira, and Github. Additionally, two tools that have been indispensable to me as a developer are planning poker and daily stand-up meetings. The use of agile methods alleviates the stress often associated with large-scale software development projects by breaking them down into manageable chunks and ensuring that a stable solution is delivered at the end. As they say, perseverance is key to success.


## 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A full-stack development bootcamp taught me this, and I believe it's crucial. Members of a team can have vastly diverse personalities. Keep in mind that you are part of a team working toward a common objective, even though there will be many different viewpoints. The goal has nothing to do with demonstrating superior programming skills or years of expertise. Getting a product to market is the aim. Because Agile markets itself as a very flexible process, developers using it must also be nimble. Everyone on the team has to be receptive to new ideas and willing to admit when they're wrong. While leading the development team at bootcamp, I made sure that everyone had a chance to speak up and contribute, regardless of whether we all agreed or disagreed. In my opinion, boosting morale and developing stronger relationships within a team depend on trust. Another reason why self-improvement is crucial is that progress can't be sustained in the absence of creative challenges.
